# modest-menu-scripts
 
 This is a collection of the scripts I made from 2022 to 2024, back when modest menu was still alive and Lua scripting was added.

AFAIK none of these work now because modest menu is outdated.

 All of these were uploaded by me to UnknownCheats previously, this is a reupload to GitHub.

### AppleVegas's PlayerList Script

***
### AppleVegas's BountySuite

Ever wanted to set bounty on yourself? To set a bounty with a custom amount? To set bounties without cooldown?
Got you covered!

Features:
- Setting a custom bounty
- Quick selection of "nice" numbers 
- Modifying bounty amount when calling Lester
- Setting bounty on yourself
- Player List to set bounties on players without any cooldowns
- Ability to set bounties for an entire lobby (only use if you are reckless modmenu user)

***
### AppleVegas's PlayerLog

It logs all players that you have happened to be in lobby with (although it is a lot more useful at logging modders). Also it logs all the modders that the script has detected and logs their player names as well.


**Event Logger features:**
- Logging to file
- Logging to Debug Console
- Logging Player Joins/Leaves
- Logging Player Deaths
- Logging Player Teleportations (huge distance travelled in a small amount of time, configurable in settings)
- Logging whenever player enabled or disabled GodMode.

### AppleVegas's AutoHeal

### Rainbow Car Script

***
### Noclip Script

A little noclip script i made because i gotbored of walking...
Can be activated either from the menu (speed canbe adjusted there too), or by pressing number 3 on the keyboard (at least that bind isconvenient for me ;P)

To activate it you should be on foot and standstill.

### Change Model Script

***
### Trick or Treat Effects Script

This script allows you to trigger halloween trick or treat effects. Also a potential money hack, if you press "Trigger Money" a lot of times. (it triggers 50k each time) But i don't recommend, because i haven't tested it for bans.

You can d r u g, explode, shock, up-n-atomize yoursef, which is fun.
